It’s about capturing the emotion, witnessing the moment and writing a story in the form of art. \n\nI’ve made it my life’s mission to capture my client’s most special and beautiful moments in the form an image, an everlasting memory that they can cherish forever.\n\nSome of my recent work can be seen on my facebook and instagram pages. \n\n\n</p>\n<p>- Muneeb Javed</p>\n<hr/>\n</div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br/>\n<ContactForm/>\n<Footer/>\n        </div>\n        \n      )\n    }\n  }\n\n\n  export default About","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport Toolbar from '../../components/Toolbar/Toolbar'\nimport Carousel5 from '../../components/Carousel/Carousel'\nimport Parallax from '../../components/Parallax/Parallax'\nimport PhotosGrid from '../../components/PhotosGrid/PhotosGrid'\nimport ContactForm from '../../components/ContactForm/ContactForm'\nimport Footer from '../../components/Footer/Footer'\nimport MediaQuery from \"react-responsive\";\nimport Backdrop from '../../components/Backdrop/Backdrop'\n\nimport SideDrawer from '../../components/SideDrawer/SideDrawer'\nimport './Contact.css';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass MainPage extends Component {\n  state = {\n    sideDrawerOpen: false,\n  }\n\n\n  componentDidMount(){\n    ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView();\n    document.body.classList.add(\"MainPage\");\n    \n\n}\n\ncomponentWillUnmount() {\n  \n  document.body.classList.remove(\"MainPage\");\n\n}\n\n  drawerToggleClickHandler = () => {\n    this.setState(prevState => {\n      return { sideDrawerOpen: !prevState.sideDrawerOpen }\n    })\n  }\n\n  backdropClickHandler = () => {\n    this.setState({ sideDrawerOpen: false })\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    \n   \n\n    let backdrop;\n    if (this.state.sideDrawerOpen) {\n      backdrop = <Backdrop click={this.backdropClickHandler} />;\n    }\n\n    \n    return (\n      <div classname=\"MainPage\" style={{height: '100%'}}>\n\n\n\n \n        \n        <MediaQuery maxDeviceWidth={650}>\n        <br/> \n        <br/>   \n        <br/> \n        </MediaQuery>\n      \n        <Carousel5 /> \n       \n    \n\n\n      <br/>\n      <div className=\"flexCenter\">\n\n       \n        \n      </div>\n       \n \n\n\n      <br/>\n    \n  \n      \n\n      <br/>\n      <ContactForm id='main-contact-form' className='contact-form' name='contact-form' method='post' action='' />\n      <Footer />\n      <Toolbar drawerClickHandler={this.drawerToggleClickHandler} /> \n                   \n                   <SideDrawer show={this.state.sideDrawerOpen} />\n                   {backdrop}\n      </div>\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MainPage","/* eslint-disable jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid */\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Image1 from '../../Pictures/Events/eventsPic.jpg';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport { browserHistory } from \"react-router\";\nimport { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom'\n\n\n\n\nimport './CardsEvents.css';\n\n\n\nclass Cards extends React.Component {\n\n    muskan() {\n       \n        window.location.assign(\"https://mjvdx.com/#/Prom\");\n        \n    \n    }\n    lovetoronto() {\n        \n        window.location.assign(\"https://mjvdx.com/#/LoveToronto\");\n        \n    }\n    billyball() {\n       \n        window.location.assign(\"https://mjvdx.com/#/BillyBall\");\n       \n    }\n    baby() {\n  \n        window.location.assign(\"https://www.mjvdx.com/#/Baby\");\n      \n    }\n\nrender() {\n\nreturn (\n\n\n<div className=\"obtainwidth\">\n\n    <div className=\"cardsflexcontainer\">\n\n\n\n\n        <div className=\"cardsflexitem\">\n           \n         \n            <a onClick={this.muskan} className=\"album-buttonprom\"> \n\t        MUSKAN'S PROM</a>\n                \n         </div>\n\n\n    <div className=\"cardsflexitem\">\n\n                \n            <a onClick={this.lovetoronto} className=\"album-button1love\">\n            LOVETORONTO PRODUCT SHOOT</a>\n            \n    </div>\n\n\n    <div className=\"cardsflexitem\">\n            \n            <a onClick={this.billyball} className=\"album-button2billy\">\n            BILLYBALL2K19</a>\n            \n    </div>\n\n\n\n    <div className=\"cardsflexitem\">\n                \n            <a onClick={this.baby} className=\"album-button3baby\">\n            BABY PHOTOS</a>\n            \n    </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    <div className=\"cardsflexitem1\">\n        <h1 style={{color:\"white\"}}>Events</h1> \n        <p style={{color:\"white\"}}>A variety of different events captured via candids and staged photos!

I came across Muneeb who was very polite and understanding and was able to take my appointment despite him having a busy schedule. He arrived on time at the location for the shoot with his camera and the poses ready. He was very efficient and quick and knew right away which pose to do one after the other. He made me and my fiancé feel comfortable and we were very pleased. After the photo shoot, our pictures arrived 1-2 weeks later. My fiancé and I were surprised to know they were ready so fast as we were eagerly waiting to see them. \n\nAfter seeing the pictures, I must say I was very shocked. Muneeb did a tremendous job. The angle, lighting and pose in every picture was perfect. He captured every magical moment for us and allowed us to keep these wonderful memories. He is a talented photographer who I definitely recommend as he will capture beautiful memories that you can keep. Thank you Muneeb for capturing these memories, I will cherish them forever.”</p>\n<span className=\"spancolor\">Ayesha Khan</span>\n         </div>\n        \n    </div>\n    </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n

            <p className=\"colorwhite\">\n                Packages are all available for viewing, in the package section.  Rates and collections can also vary based on the specific type of event and the type of coverage you are looking for. Custom collections are generally created for most clients, the packages are a starting point! Please get in touch so I can provide a custom quote.\n                </p>\n               \n\n\n\n                <h3 className=\"boldp\" id=\"C2\">Do you edit all of our photographs?</h3>\n                <p className=\"colorwhite\">\n                Yes!

A complimentary e-shoot is included in every package you choose! I will consult with you to discuss cool/unique concepts for the e-shoot that reflect YOUR personality! E-shoots are done a month prior to the wedding so you can get a print to display on the wedding day! Please contact me for more information!\n                </p>\n\n            \n\n\n                <h3 className=\"boldp\" id=\"C4\">Is there a permit required for the photo-shoot location?</h3>\n                <p className=\"colorwhite\">\n                Some locations require a permit and some don’t. Based on the location, we will help you figure out if a permit is required. The permit has to be obtained by the client, not the photographer.\n                </p>\n\n\n                 <h3 className=\"boldp\" id=\"C5\">How do we get the photographs?</h3>\n                <p className=\"colorwhite\">\n                Depending on the package you choose, the delivery for the photos varies! All packages have an online gallery or drive where the pictures will be stored! You can easily download them from the online gallery. However, if you wish to have all the pictures without any compression, a USB option (mailed or delivered) is available as an add-on and included in some packages!\n                </p>\n\n\n                <h3 className=\"boldp\" id=\"C6\">How long will it take to receive the photographs?</h3>\n                <p className=\"colorwhite\">\n                Depending on the size of the wedding and event, generally two to four weeks is the turnaround time for all the pictures. Speedy photography delivery is also available as an add-on! Photo albums are delivered within four weeks once the album layout and design has been approved.\n                </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"boldp\" id=\"C7\">Do we receive the raw, unedited photos?</h3>\n                <p className=\"colorwhite\">\n                No. The raw, unedited photos are not available. \n                </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"boldp\" id=\"C8\">How many pictures do we receive?</h3>\n                <p className=\"colorwhite\">\n                The amount of pictures received vary on a number of factor. Some of these include the length of coverage, type of event etc. A typical eight hour day with a secondary photographer can range from 500+ images, but can be more or less based on the factors. \n                </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"boldp\" id=\"C9\">Do we get to keep the digital files?</h3>\n                <p className=\"colorwhite\">\n                Yes!

The pictures that are duplicates, out of focus, blocked by something, eyes are closed etc are removed. These picture are not available. I go through this process for you and save you time!\n                </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"boldp\" id=\"C11\">Do you come to the rehearsal?</h3>\n                <p className=\"colorwhite\">\n                Yes!
